Shapes are exact mathematical boundaries (not triangle meshes), so booleans are precise, measurements are real, and you can export to STEP. TypeScript types prove the geometry is valid at compile time.

```typescript
// Drill a hole, fillet the vertical edges, export to STEP
import { box, cut, cylinder, fillet, edgeFinder, exportSTEP, unwrap } from 'brepjs/quick';

const b = box(30, 20, 10);
const hole = cylinder(5, 15, { at: [15, 10, -2] });
const drilled = unwrap(cut(b, hole));

const edges = edgeFinder().inDirection('Z').findAll(drilled);
const part = unwrap(fillet(drilled, edges, 1.5));

const step = unwrap(exportSTEP(part));
```

## Why?

brepjs grew out of the love and care I put into [gridfinitylayouttool.com](https://gridfinitylayouttool.com). I needed parametric CAD in the browser and I'm not a 3D modeler, but I know TypeScript. [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) nailed code-first CAD but lives outside the JS ecosystem. [replicad](https://replicad.xyz/) proved OpenCascade works in JS but I kept hitting performance walls and fighting the API.

Neither had the type safety I wanted, so brepjs leans hard on it: branded types, `Result<T,E>`, phantom types that prove invariants at compile time. If it compiles, the geometry is valid. It's strongest at exact, manufacturable geometry — precise booleans, fillets, chamfers and shells; real volumes, areas and clearances; watertight solids that round-trip through STEP — from a single part to a full assembly (enclosures, brackets, fixtures, gridfinity bins, machined and molded parts). It isn't built for organic sculpting or dense lattices; that's what field-based (implicit/voxel) modeling is for.

## Scope

To set expectations, this project deliberately does not:

- **Render or display geometry**: brepjs produces shape data; pass mesh output to Three.js, Babylon.js, or raw WebGL for rendering.
- **Support organic or sculpting workflows**: brepjs models exact mechanical solids — parts and assemblies; freeform/organic sculpting and dense lattices are out of scope (that's field-based implicit/voxel territory).
- **Output SVG or 2D files**: 2D drawing primitives exist solely as an intermediate step toward extruded 3D solids, not as a standalone 2D output format.
- **Run server-side (SSR)**: WASM requires a browser or Node.js environment with WASM support; server-side rendering frameworks (Next.js, Nuxt, Remix) need a client-only import.
- **Provide a GUI**: brepjs is a pure programmatic API; there is no visual editor, viewport, or file picker.

## Status

[occt-wasm](https://github.com/andymai/occt-wasm) (OpenCascade compiled to WebAssembly) is the default kernel. [brepkit](https://github.com/andymai/brepkit), a Rust-based kernel, is in active development as a faster replacement but not yet ready for production use. The kernel abstraction layer means switching is a one-line change. See [benchmarks](./benchmarks/results/latest.md) for performance comparisons.

## Install

```bash
npm install brepjs occt-wasm
```

`brepjs/quick` handles WASM init automatically via top-level await (ESM only). Other options:

```typescript
// Auto-detect kernel
import { init } from 'brepjs';
await init();

// Or manual setup
import { OcctKernel } from 'occt-wasm';
import { registerKernel, OcctWasmAdapter } from 'brepjs';
const kernel = await OcctKernel.init();
registerKernel('occt-wasm', OcctWasmAdapter.fromKernel(kernel));
```

## Usage

The chapter-based guide is the recommended starting point:

- **[Why brepjs](https://brepjs.dev/introduction/why-brepjs)**: what makes it different, who it's for
- **[Install & Initialize](https://brepjs.dev/getting-started/install)**: three init styles, bundler notes
- **[Your First Solid](https://brepjs.dev/getting-started/first-solid)**: the canonical drill-fillet-export workflow
- **[Cheat Sheet](https://brepjs.dev/getting-started/cheat-sheet)**: single-page reference
- **[Core Concepts](https://brepjs.dev/concepts/brep-vs-mesh)**: B-Rep, topology, types, kernels, tolerance
- **[Common Tasks](https://brepjs.dev/tasks/booleans)**: booleans, fillets, sketching, lofts, sweeps, finders, measurement, IO
- **[Three.js Integration](https://brepjs.dev/integration/threejs)**: meshing and rendering
- **[Migration](https://brepjs.dev/migration/replicad)**: coming from Replicad, OpenSCAD, or Three.js
- **[Extending brepjs](https://brepjs.dev/extending/architecture)**: custom kernels, custom operations, architecture
- **[Reference](https://brepjs.dev/reference/glossary)**: glossary, function lookup, error codes, ADRs
- **[API Reference (TypeDoc)](https://andymai.github.io/brepjs/)**: searchable type-level reference

Legacy single-page docs in [./docs/](./docs/) remain available; the chapter site is the canonical location going forward.

### Architecture

```
Layer 3  sketching/, text/, projection/   High-level API
Layer 2  topology/, operations/, 2d/ ...  Domain logic
Layer 1  core/                            Types, memory, errors
Layer 0  kernel/, utils/                  WASM bindings
```

Imports flow downward only. Boundaries are enforced in CI.

## Authoring CAD with AI (brepjs-cad)

[`brepjs-cad`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/brepjs-cad) helps an AI agent (or you) author CAD in brepjs and **prove it is correct** before handing it off. An LLM can't see geometry, so it writes a `.brep.ts` part, runs it on a real kernel, and reads a deterministic report instead of guessing from how the code reads. It ships as two cooperating pieces: a **Claude Code skill** (the authoring loop) and a **verification CLI** (validity + measured dimensions + multi-view snapshots + STEP export).

Install both; they ride on two rails:

```bash
# 1. The skill - Claude Code plugin (delivered via this repo's marketplace)
#    In a Claude Code session:
/plugin marketplace add andymai/brepjs
/plugin install brepjs@brepjs
#    …or from a terminal, non-interactively:
claude plugin marketplace add andymai/brepjs
claude plugin install brepjs@brepjs

# 2. The runtime - the CLI the skill drives
npm i -D brepjs-cad
```

With the skill installed, ask Claude for a part in plain English, or drive the pipeline explicitly with `/brepjs:cad "a 40×20×10 mm bracket with two M4 holes"`.

`brepjs-cad` bundles its own `brepjs` + `occt-wasm`, so it runs in an empty directory; inside an existing brepjs project it prefers your installed versions so verified parts match what you ship. A model is a module that default-exports a zero-arg function returning a shape:

```typescript
// bracket.brep.ts
import { box } from 'brepjs';
export const expected = { volume: 8000, tolerancePct: 1 }; // optional: assert intent
export default () => box(40, 20, 10, { centered: true });
```

```bash
npx -y -p brepjs-cad brep bracket.brep.ts --check --step bracket.step --json report.json
```

The command exits non-zero unless the report is `ok` (valid **and** every declared dimension within tolerance), so it drops straight into CI or an agent loop. For MCP-capable agents the package also ships a stdio MCP server (`brep-mcp`) exposing the same build-and-verify step as a `run_program` tool. See the [**Authoring with AI**](https://brepjs.dev/agent/overview) guide for the full loop, CLI reference, the MCP server, examples, and the measurement eval.
