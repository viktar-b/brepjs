# Monorepo companion packages

The root `package.json` `workspaces` field is the source of truth for the monorepo layout: 11 packages under `packages/` plus `apps/playground` and `apps/docs`. The `## Packages` list in `CLAUDE.md` is a curated subset — when it disagrees with the manifests, trust the manifests.

Three tiers, and the rules differ per tier:

1. **Published satellites** (opencascade, bim, families, sheetmetal, cad, viewer, create-brepjs): consumers may resolve them from the npm registry, so their manifests must always describe an installable package.
2. **Source-shipped internals** (manifold, voxel, voxel-wasm): resolved only through workspace symlinks; manifold and voxel have no build step at all — editing their `src/` is immediately live for consumers.
3. **Private** (vscode, playground, docs): never published; playground and docs deploy via Vercel/Pages instead.

READMEs exist only for bim, families, sheetmetal, cad, and viewer — point users there for per-package API detail rather than restating it.

## Workspace dependency rules

- **Satellites depend on `brepjs` as a floor-ranged peerDependency**: `"brepjs": ">=18.0.0"` in `packages/brepjs-bim/package.json`, `packages/brepjs-families/package.json`, and `packages/brepjs-sheetmetal/package.json`. Exception: `brepjs-cad` takes brepjs as a real dependency (`">=18.117.1"`) because its CLI must run standalone.
- **bim depends on families as a bounded range**: `"brepjs-families": ">=0.1.0 <1.0.0"` in `packages/brepjs-bim/package.json` (runtime dep for `familiesToBim` consumers; the adapter itself only type-imports families, so bim's dist bundles none of it). Release ordering: the families release PR merges before bim's.
- **Root brepjs's kernel packages are optional peers**: `brepjs-manifold`, `brepjs-opencascade`, `brepkit-wasm`, `occt-wasm` are all `optional: true` under `peerDependenciesMeta` in the root `package.json`. Never promote one to a hard dependency — consumers pick exactly one kernel.
- **Internal cross-references use `"*"`** (e.g. `"brepjs-viewer": "*"` in `apps/playground` and in brepjs-cad's devDependencies). npm workspaces symlink these locally. Gotcha: Dependabot scans each sub-manifest without a co-located lockfile, so an unconstrained `"*"` on an _external_ dev tool reads as permitting every vulnerable version. Fix by constraining a floor on the flagged spec (`"vite": "^8.0.0"`, `"vitest": "^4.0.0"` — see `packages/brepjs-viewer/package.json`), not by lockfile churn.
- **`brepjs-viewer` role differs per consumer**: runtime `dependency` of the playground; build-time `devDependency` of brepjs-cad (its viewer bundle inlines it — see the `packages-verify` comment in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Viewer declares its react/three/fiber/drei peers as floor ranges (`>=19`, `>=0.184`, etc.) compatible with the playground's versions, so npm dedups to one copy monorepo-wide; rationale in `packages/brepjs-viewer/README.md`.
- **npm overrides use nested-object syntax**: `"vitepress": { "vite": "6.4.3" }` in root `package.json` `overrides`, plus scoped-range keys like `"esbuild@<0.25.0": "^0.25.0"`. There is no pnpm-style `parent>dep` separator in npm.
- **Never regenerate `package-lock.json` from scratch.** For security floors, edit the spec then run `npm install --package-lock-only` (no re-resolution, no churn). Full regeneration has historically dropped required `@emnapi/*` peer entries and broken CI.
- **0.x caret hazard**: `brepjs-voxel` pins `"brepjs-voxel-wasm": ">=0.2.0"` as a plain range, not `^0.x` — a `^0.1.0` caret excludes `0.2.0`, and an internal 0.x bump once left consumers pointing at a version that was never published, 404-ing `npm ci` repo-wide. Use `>=` floors for unpublished internal 0.x packages.

## Build order

Workspace symlinks resolve _manifests_ instantly, but built packages resolve through their `dist/` — a stale or missing dist fails typecheck or, worse, silently runs old code.

Three ordered chains, all encoded in scripts (prefer running the script over hand-ordering):

1. **Playground** — `build:deps` in `apps/playground/package.json` builds brepjs-bim, brepjs-sheetmetal, and brepjs-viewer, and runs automatically as `predev`/`prebuild`. If playground behavior looks stale after editing a companion package, this chain (or a manual `npm run build --workspace=<pkg>`) is the fix.
2. **Full site** — root `build:site`: provision-fonts → root build → brepjs-bim → brepjs-sheetmetal → apps/playground → apps/docs → copy playground dist into the docs dist.
3. **brepjs-cad** — root `npm run build` → `npm run build --workspace=brepjs-viewer` → `npm run build --workspace=brepjs-cad`. The cad viewer worker imports `brepjs` and bundles `brepjs-viewer`, so both dists must exist first; CI's `packages-verify` job and `publish-brepjs-cad.yml` both follow this order.

**WASM bootstrap**: the OpenCascade runtime files (`brepjs_single.js`/`.wasm`) are gitignored. Root `prepare` runs `scripts/ensure-wasm.sh`, which downloads them from the published `brepjs-opencascade` npm package into `packages/brepjs-opencascade/src`, keyed by a `.wasm-version` marker. Corollary: `npm ci --ignore-scripts` skips the download — fine when WASM is not needed (`publish-brepjs-viewer.yml` does this deliberately), otherwise re-run `bash scripts/ensure-wasm.sh` manually (`publish-brepjs-cad.yml` does, with retries).

## Release and publish (summary)

The package topology that shapes the pipeline lives in [references/publish-pipeline.md](references/publish-pipeline.md); the operator mechanics live in the **release-publishing** skill. The shape:

- `release-please-config.json` manages 8 components: root, opencascade, voxel-wasm, cad, bim, families, sheetmetal, create-brepjs; separate PRs per component and no plugins (`plugins: []`). Viewer and voxel are deliberately excluded.
- Leaf release PRs are **held until the root brepjs release merges** — merging a leaf first pins it to an unpublished brepjs version and breaks `npm ci` with ETARGET.
- npm OIDC trusted publishers are bound to specific workflow **filenames**, so release-please _dispatches_ each `publish-brepjs-*.yml` rather than inlining `npm publish`.
- Every `publish-*.yml` is `workflow_dispatch` with `dry_run` defaulting to **true** — a bare manual dispatch is a safe dry run; pass `dry_run=false` to actually publish.

See the **release-publishing** skill for the operator playbook on cutting and recovering releases; this skill covers only how the package topology shapes that pipeline.

## CI coverage per package

| Workspace                                         | CI gate (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)                                                      |

| root                                              | typecheck/lint/boundaries/patterns + 4-way sharded tests                                  |
| brepjs-viewer                                     | `packages-viewer`: typecheck, lint, test, build                                           |
| brepjs-cad                                        | `packages-verify`: typecheck, lint, test, build, eval, smoke, smoke:standalone            |
| brepjs-sheetmetal                                 | `packages-sheetmetal`: typecheck, lint, test, build                                       |
| brepjs-bim                                        | `packages-bim`: typecheck, lint, test, build                                              |
| brepjs-voxel-wasm                                 | `voxel-wasm-rust`: cargo test + clippy (path-filtered on `packages/brepjs-voxel-wasm/**`) |
| apps/playground                                   | `playground-build` (path-filtered; mirrors the Vercel build)                              |
| brepjs-vscode, brepjs-manifold, brepjs-voxel (TS) | **no CI job** — changes here are ungated; run their checks manually                       |

Two consequences worth internalizing: root `npm run validate` does **not** cover satellites (run `npm run <script> --workspace=<name>` directly when touching one), and the ungated packages rot silently — verify manually before relying on them.

## Adding a new workspace package — checklist

1. Add the directory to root `package.json` `workspaces`.
2. Decide the tier: published (needs build, `files`, exports to `dist/`, a `publish-<name>.yml` workflow, and an npm trusted-publisher entry bound to that filename), source-shipped (`exports` → `./src/index.ts`, no build — copy `packages/brepjs-voxel/package.json`), or `private: true`.
3. Dependency shape: `brepjs` as `">=18.0.0"` peerDependency for library satellites; internal siblings as `"*"`; floor-constrain any external dev tool that Dependabot might flag.
4. If published: add entries to `release-please-config.json` and `.release-please-manifest.json`, and a dispatch job in `release-please.yml` (mirror `publish-brepjs-bim`). If it must not auto-release (like viewer), leave it out of the config _and_ add it to the root component's `exclude-paths`.
5. Add a CI job in `ci.yml` modeled on `packages-bim` (build root first if the package imports `brepjs` through dist exports).
6. If the playground consumes it, append it to `build:deps` in `apps/playground/package.json`.
7. `npm install` from the repo root to register the workspace in the lockfile — never regenerate the lockfile wholesale.
